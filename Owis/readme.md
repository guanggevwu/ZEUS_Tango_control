# user_defined_locations.txt

This file stores the user-defined locations. Everytime we start the GUI, the client side "user_defined_locations.txt" will be sent to the server. Thus the "user_defined_locations.txt" on the most recent client computer takes effect.
Space is used a delimiters. No space for name or positions. The positions of multiple axes are seperated by ",".

# attribute_config.json

This file stores the configurations for ax_position. Only the server-side file takes effect.
