# user_defined_locations.txt

This file stores the user-defined locations. Everytime we start the GUI, the client side "xx_locations.txt" will be sent to the server as long as it is not empty. Thus the "user_defined_locations.txt" on the most recent client computer takes effect.
Space is used a delimiters. No space should be contained in name or positions. The positions of multiple axes are seperated by ",".
